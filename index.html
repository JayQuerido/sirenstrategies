								Lori immediately felt like a kindred spirit - someone wise and supportive who had my best interest at
								heart. Her keen insight and positive, professional attitude made working with her such a rewarding and
								pleasant experience.
								While her specialty was not in the arts, she provided me with rich information and suggestions to help
								me achieve my goals. Lori asked perceptive questions and listened to all that I had to say. She came up
								with innovative ideas that had not occurred to me. She worked with me to develop goals and measurable
								steps that fit with my expectations and abilities.
							</p>

							<p>
								I am completely satisfied with the results of my sessions with Lori. I now have the tools, a clear vision of
								where I am going and the inspiration to <em>“go for it”</em>.

								Lori brought all the puzzle pieces of my business together with a cohesive plan, but what impressed me
								most? She listened skillfully, and got up to speed quickly with the unique peculiarities of my art and craft
								business. The results will drive my marketing plan for the next five years, and probably well beyond.

								Lori did a great job helping us improve our website, integrate social media into our day to day business

								Lori and I met three years ago after connecting on Twitter. We had coffee and talked about life, careers,
								aspirations and goals. It was so much fun to meet up once in a while, run into each other at events and
								get updates on her progress. Lori's curiosity and genuine desire to help others was palpable. Then we had
								the chance to work together and despite her request for help, I felt she was helping me more than I was
								helping her! Lori's interest in learning and helping her clients was undeniable. She is a friend, a colleague
								and someone I look forward to continuing to learn from for years to come.

							<p>
								I contacted Lori to discuss my ideas. I was so impressed with how quickly she grasped my vision and
								through pointed questions, enabled me to realize the potential of my project far beyond my initial
								expectations. With her attention to detail in helping me create a strategic design, we came up with a
								plan that outlined goals, community involvement and how to best use social media.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lori has the unique ability to work collaboratively, offering a variety of creative ideas and direction while
								not taking ownership away from its creator.

							<p>I am excited about continuing my work with Lori.</p>

								Lori was instrumental in the launch of a new business. She took ideas and thoughts and turned them
								into a workable, constructive plan of attack, breaking everything down to a simple structure of goals,
								objectives and strategies. I look forward to continuing my work with Lori, her passion and enthusiasm is
								contagious, and her knowledge of strategic planning and social media is second to none.
							</p>
							<p>Thank you Lori!!</p>
