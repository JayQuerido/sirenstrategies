						<blockquote>
							<p>Lori immediately felt like a kindred spirit - someone wise and supportive who had my best interest at
							heart. Her keen insight and positive, professional attitude made working with her such a rewarding and
							pleasant experience.
							While her specialty was not in the arts, she provided me with rich information and suggestions to help
							me achieve my goals. Lori asked perceptive questions and listened to all that I had to say. She came up
							with innovative ideas that had not occurred to me. She worked with me to develop goals and measurable
							steps that fit with my expectations and abilities.</p>

							<p>I am completely satisfied with the results of my sessions with Lori. I now have the tools, a clear vision of
							where I am going and the inspiration to <em>“go for it”</em>.</p>
						</blockquote>

					<li>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Lori brought all the puzzle pieces of my business together with a cohesive plan, but what impressed me
							most? She listened skillfully, and got up to speed quickly with the unique peculiarities of my art and craft
							business. The results will drive my marketing plan for the next five years, and probably well beyond.</p>
						</blockquote>

					<li>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Lori did a great job helping us improve our website, integrate social media into our day to day business
							routines, and quantify what our goals were around our web presence. I highly recommend Lori for your
							next strategic project.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p class="author">Alan M.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Lori and I met three years ago after connecting on Twitter. We had coffee and talked about life, careers,
							aspirations and goals. It was so much fun to meet up once in a while, run into each other at events and
							get updates on her progress. Lori's curiosity and genuine desire to help others was palpable. Then we had
							the chance to work together and despite her request for help, I felt she was helping me more than I was
							helping her! Lori's interest in learning and helping her clients was undeniable. She is a friend, a colleague
							and someone I look forward to continuing to learn from for years to come.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p class="author">Kneale M.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<blockquote>
							<p>I contacted Lori to discuss my ideas. I was so impressed with how quickly she grasped my vision and
							through pointed questions, enabled me to realize the potential of my project far beyond my initial
							expectations. With her attention to detail in helping me create a strategic design, we came up with a
							plan that outlined goals, community involvement and how to best use social media.</p>

							<p>Lori has the unique ability to work collaboratively, offering a variety of creative ideas and direction while
							not taking ownership away from its creator.</p>

							<p>I am excited about continuing my work with Lori.</p>

					<li>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Lori was instrumental in the launch of a new business. She took ideas and thoughts and turned them
							into a workable, constructive plan of attack, breaking everything down to a simple structure of goals,
							objectives and strategies. I look forward to continuing my work with Lori, her passion and enthusiasm is
							contagious, and her knowledge of strategic planning and social media is second to none.</p>
							<p>Thank you Lori!!</p>
